Description: eBPF-based TCP fingerprint firewall
 TCP Fingerprint Firewall operates at the bleeding edge of network defense
 technology, leveraging eBPF/XDP capability to intercept and analyze packet
 traffic at wire speed before it reaches your network stack.
 .
 The firewall identifies and blocks scanning tools by their unique TCP
 fingerprints during the reconnaissance phase.
